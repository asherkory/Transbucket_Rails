    <p class="lead"><strong>TransBucket.com</strong> was created Summer 2009 after the shutdown of <%= link_to 'Transster.com',  "http://wayback.archive.org/web/20010815000000*/http://www.transster.com" %> (2001-2009), a surgery photosharing website exclusively for FTMs.</span> In Fall 2012, the original founders Kit and Ryan moved on from active management of the site, passing on responsibility to Alex.</p>

    <h3>Who is welcome here?</h3>
    <p>We hope to build on the foundation of Transster, and offer a surgery outcomes resource for the <b>entire online trans community</b>, from FTMs to MTFs to genderqueers, agender individuals, and everyone else who could benefit from exploring the real life experiences collected here. Still, for historical reasons, content is heavily skewed towards FTM procedures.</p>
    <p>We aim to be as inclusive as possible, and do not make any judgements on what constitutes a trans identification. The site is for those that have undergone procedures, so we don't need to require specific identifications. For that reason, we recognize even individuals that identify as "detrans" or "desisted" or "post-trans" should be welcome to share their medical experiences here.</p>
    <p><mark>When you participate on the site, keep in mind our inclusive tenets,</mark> no matter how you identify or how you feel about your outcomes or the outcomes of others. Your outcomes don't predict other people's outcomes, and your feelings don't predict other people's feelings. It's easy to forget you're looking at real bodies, which belong to real human beings with real feelings. What you say has real consequences. Posts and comments are moderated by the community and volunteers, and can be removed at any time with no notice.</p>
    <h3>Why are there ads?</h3>
    <p>In 2021, Alex added ads to the site after paying for hosting costs out of pocket for almost a decade. With these ads, the site is now self-sustaining given the existing hosting costs and traffic level.</p> 
    <p>If you're interested in volunteering to help work on development efforts, moderation, or alternatives to funding the site, please reach out!</p>
