  <p><strong>TransBucket.com</strong> was created Summer 2009 after the shutdown of <%= link_to 'Transter.com',  "http://wayback.archive.org/web/20010815000000*/http://www.transster.com" %> (2001-2009), a surgery photosharing website exclusively for FTMs. <br /><br />Rather than simply replace Transster, a new founding vision was to create a site that would be a health care and surgery resource for the <b>entire online trans* community</b>, from FTMs to MTFs to genderqueers, allies, and everyone else who could benefit from exploring the real life experiences collected here.
<br /><br />As of Fall 2012, the original founders Kit and Ryan have moved on from active management of the site. The site is owned and developed by Alex, and the image queue and forum are moderated by Jake. Both of us are trans* people, and are committed to the founding principle of an inclusive resource for the entire community.
<br /><br />You can contact us using the form below or directly to <a href="mailto:webmaster@transbucket.com">Alex</a> about site issues, and <a href="mailto:admin@transbucket.com">Jake</a> about queue and forum questions. If you'd like to volunteer, please let either of us know. Members of currently underrepresented communities will be given priority.</p>
